 # Crisis Center 
 
 We package it in our project to dare for accept the challenge the Call For Code 2020 by building it using IBM technology by making [toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains/202bc213-7a11-41dd-b8e3-d5e2c1a72d3f?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Ajp-tok) and Trying to create an [Integrated Chatbot Communication Project](https://integrations.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/web/public/56f076e2-31ba-485c-a5a9-ab4c29e5a41a)  that can be useful in solving crises and other issues for the future.
 
## The idea
The goal is to provide a mobile application, along with server-side components, that serves as the basis for developers to build out a community cooperation application that addresses local needs for food, equipment, and resources. It would allow both "Suppliers" (such as a store or a community member who has produce they can sell or distribute) to make people aware of what the have; and consumers ("Recipients") to locate where these supplies are, and, if necessary, guide them to the appropriate locations to pick them up.The previous year we called our Application with [Dispots](https://transdigiware.github.io/Dispots/)

## Communication
[Communication](https://integrations.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/web/public/56f076e2-31ba-485c-a5a9-ab4c29e5a41a)
were being to terintegrasi Includes the entire project in handling disasters so that it is hoped that the disaster management process can be arranged in a maximum way.platform chatbot sending messages can help convey information quickly and precisely. This can save people time compared to waiting to be downtown, and freeing customers at the center to focus on higher level issues and By opening a page that can be accessed globally, like as in general custom example [code](https://github.com/transdigiware/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020).

## Media Info 
This Project Media Info is built as a source of information about Media that contains public domain-based web addresses that can be accessed based on Big  data that can be used in an emergency, we package the making in
For Cricis Center Disaster Management Tools, Apps and more power full technologi.
In the crisis, we have already seen shortages of local food, medical equipment, and other supplies. In addition, the recommended (or required) self-isolation and social distancing measures can compound the problem by preventing people from easily getting to locations with the best stocks of supplies. Media Info is a solution that empowers communities to easily connect and provide this information to each other.Berikut adalah kode contoh dari Starter Kit [Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020](https://github.com/transdigiware/Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020)

## Climate Change
What is happening right now in the process of the earth's rotation and its material matter, the negative excess caused is climate change colored with various kinds of impacts. Certainly at this time we are busy with the material of the nCovid-19 plague disaster whose distribution knows no bounds, so we have to limit it with a technology that is able to answer all cases that occur. In this case we try to develop the project long before all of that happens which can be noticed in [Repositories Dispots](https://github.com/transdigiware/Dispots)
